# Woale Wiki Engine

woale is a small and fast cgi wiki engine written in C++.

The wiki pages are stored in an SQLite database. The pages are written in
[markdown] and are rendered in the browser using a JavaScript library. woale is
developed using the [marked] markdown parser, although any other
language/parser library could be used instead.
