# FindCgicc
# ---------
#
# Find libcgicc include dirs and libraries.
#
# Use this module by invoking find_package with the form:
#
#   find_package(Cgicc
#     [REQUIRED]             # Fail with error if the library is not found
#     )
#
# This module finds headers and requested component libraries.  Results are
# reported in variables:
#
#   Cgicc_FOUND             - True if headers and requested libraries were found
#   Cgicc_INCLUDE_DIRS      - include directories
#   Cgicc_LIBRARIES         - libcgicc component libraries to be linked
#
#
# The following import target is created
#
#   Cgicc::Cgicc

# Use pkg-config (if available) to find the directories of the componants.
